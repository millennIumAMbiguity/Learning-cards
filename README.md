# Learning Cards

---
Learning cards are essentially a mod-loader for an empty game.
In other words, a game engine.
This game engine is primarily made to make card games, but it can be used for other purposes.
Using a custom scripting language, its user can create complex behaviors.
The script in question is executed in the game in real-time and allows the code of its content to be modified at any time.
